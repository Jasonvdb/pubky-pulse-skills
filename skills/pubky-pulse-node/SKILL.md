name: pubky-pulse-node
description: >-
  Adds the Pubky Pulse Node SDK to a backend — Express, Fastify, Hono, Nest, tRPC,
  serverless handlers, workers and cron jobs. Covers configuration, the per-request
  middleware the SDK does not ship, user and session scoping, catching every error path,
  lifecycle metrics, funnel steps and graceful shutdown. Use when adding analytics or error
  tracking to an API or worker, or when a tracking plan needs backend instrumentation. Not
  for browser code (see pubky-pulse-web) or for planning what to track first (see
  pubky-pulse-instrument).

compatibility: >-
  The code changes need no MCP server. The pubky-pulse MCP server is needed only to create
  the app, read its client key, and check that events arrive. Any harness that reads
  SKILL.md.

## What is Pubky Pulse

Pubky Pulse is a self-hosted, agent-first observability product: events, metrics,
funnels, issues, feedback and questionnaires for web, backend, iOS and Android apps.
Resources nest Team → Project → App — a project is one product, an app is one
platform build of it. Four SDKs send data in: web, Node, Swift and Android.
Agents work through the Pubky Pulse MCP server, which is the only agent interface,
and no MCP tool ingests data — only SDKs do. Two key types: `pulse_client_*` is
ingest-scoped, public, and ships inside the app; `pulse_agent_*` is for MCP only and
never belongs in a browser bundle, a `NEXT_PUBLIC_*` variable, or a committed file.
Read the `pubky-pulse://guide` resource for the full tool surface.

MCP tools are written here as `pubky-pulse:<tool>` — `pubky-pulse:whoami`, for
example. Claude Code exposes the same tool as `mcp__pubky-pulse__whoami`; other
harnesses use their own prefix.
