name: pubky-pulse-web
description: >-
  Adds the Pubky Pulse web SDK to a browser app — React, Next.js, Vue, Svelte, or plain
  JavaScript. Covers configuration, catching every unhandled and caught error, screen
  tracking, events, lifecycle metrics, funnel steps, user identity, feedback and
  questionnaires, and propagating the session to the backend. Use when adding analytics or
  frontend error tracking, or when a tracking plan needs browser instrumentation. Not for
  server code (see pubky-pulse-node) or for planning what to track and creating the project
  first (see pubky-pulse-instrument).
license: MIT
compatibility: >-
  The code changes need no MCP server. The pubky-pulse MCP server is needed only to create
  the app, read its client key, and check that events arrive. Any harness that reads
  SKILL.md.

## What is Pubky Pulse

Pubky Pulse is a self-hosted, agent-first observability product: events, metrics,
funnels, issues, feedback and questionnaires for web, backend, iOS and Android apps.
Resources nest Team → Project → App — a project is one product, an app is one
platform build of it. Four SDKs send data in: web, Node, Swift and Android.
Agents work through the Pubky Pulse MCP server, which is the only agent interface,
and no MCP tool ingests data — only SDKs do. Two key types: `pulse_client_*` is
ingest-scoped, public, and ships inside the app; `pulse_agent_*` is for MCP only and
never belongs in a browser bundle, a `NEXT_PUBLIC_*` variable, or a committed file.
Read the `pubky-pulse://guide` resource for the full tool surface.

MCP tools are written here as `pubky-pulse:<tool>` — `pubky-pulse:whoami`, for
example. Claude Code exposes the same tool as `mcp__pubky-pulse__whoami`; other
harnesses use their own prefix.
